    Scenario: Adding a new payplug payment method
        Given I want to create a new PayPlug payment method
        When I name it "PayPlug" in "English (United States)"
        And I specify its code as "payplug_test"
        And I fill the Secret key with "test"
        And This secret Key is valid
        And make it available in channel "Web-USD"
        And I add it
        Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
        And the payment method "PayPlug" should appear in the registry
